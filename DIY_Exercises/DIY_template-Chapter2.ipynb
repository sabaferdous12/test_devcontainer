    "Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was invented by the Dutch computer programmer [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and was released for the first time in 1990.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level programming language is a language that enjoys strong abstraction from com- puter details. This means that it is closer to the language that is spoken and understood by humans; which put simply, makes the language more enjoyable to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [2019 developer survey conducted by StackOverflow](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/) it was found that most respondents use Python as their primary programming language. In 2020, Python was one of the most widely used [languages for Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/python/).\n",

Variables can contain letters, numbers (except for the first character) and the underscore `_`. To prevent Python from confusing variable names with meaningful commands or inbuilt functions avoid names that are highlighted by the editor. To define a variable that contains text, we use quotation marks. As long as we remain consistent, it doesn’t matter whether we use single or double quotations.
