# Student Assignment Feedback

In this folder, you will find two files, containing your marked notebook, and a marking rubric. 

## Marked Notebook:

This will be the notebook that you submitted, with tutor-initialled comments inside. These will include point-by-point explanations of any errors or recommended practices, should these be required. 

## Marking Rubric:

This file will contain your grade, together with the initials of your marker, and overall feedback for your assignment. The marking criteria that we use to award the grades is also listed, to give context on how we mark your assignemnts 

## Grades:

If you have received a Distinction or Pass, there is no further action required, on your part. 

However, if you have received a Revise, you will need to open the _MARKED notebook, and check the comments to see why you were awarded this mark. You will then be required to re-attempt this notebook, and re-submit a copy of it with _REVISED appended to the filename. Please re-upload this to this assignment_feedback folder on your repository within a week of receiving your grade, and we will re-mark this, and return it to you.

For any enquiries or questions, please make use of our [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/L2D-October2023/discussions), or [contact us by email.](mailto:admin@learntodiscover.ai)

With best wishes,

**The L2D Team**
